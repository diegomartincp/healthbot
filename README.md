# HealthBot 
HealthBot lets you supervise the accessibility of your websites (or any public domains) and sends real-time alerts via Telegram as soon as a problem is detected. No more worrying about downtime going unnoticed: receive critical notifications right on your favorite messenger!

## üí° Features
- Multi-domain monitoring: Supervise several domains at once.
- Telegram notifications: Get instant alerts if any domain is down.
- Easy setup with Docker: Run HealthBot as a lightweight Docker container or via Docker Compose.
- Environment variable configuration: Set monitored domains, bot token, and chat target in seconds.

## Getting Started
### üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Docker or Docker Compose installed.
- A Telegram Bot Token from @BotFather.
- Your Telegram chat ID (can be obtained with @userinfobot).

### üñ•Ô∏è Quickstart with Docker
``` shell
docker build -t local/healthbot:latest .
```
``` shell
docker run \
  --name health-check \
  --network health-net \
  -e HEALTH_CHECK_DOMAINS="https://www.google.com" \
  -e CHECK_INTERVAL=60 \
  -e STATUS_REPORT_INTERVAL=86400 \
  -e TELEGRAM_TOKEN="<your_bot_token>" \
  -e TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="<your_chat_id>" \
  local/healthbot:latest
```

Or with Docker Compose:
(After modifying the docker-compose.yml file with your bot token and chat ID)
``` shell
docker-compose up -d
```

The bot will regularly check the specified domains and send a Telegram message if any become unreachable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment variables usage
Set the following environment variables:
- HEALTH_CHECK_DOMAINS - Comma-separated list of domains to monitor (https://domain1.com,https://domain2.com)
- TELEGRAM_TOKEN - Token from @BotFather
- TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID - Your Telegram chat ID (use @userinfobot to find yours)
- STATUS_REPORT_INTERVAL -Time (in seconds) between periodic summary reports sent to Telegram. Default is once per day
- CHECK_INTERVAL - Time (in seconds) between individual domain checks. Default is 60 seconds.

## ü§î How it works
HealthBot periodically checks the availability (HTTP status) of each configured domain.

If a domain returns an error or is unreachable, an alert message is sent to the configured Telegram chat.

When the domain becomes healthy again, it notifies you of the recovery.

## Why use HealthBot?
- Easily monitor client sites, personal projects, or your business infrastructure from a single Telegram chat.
- Stay informed of outages before your users notice.
- Simple yet extensible: suitable for personal and small business use cases.
